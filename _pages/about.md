I hold the position of Senior Robotics Researcher at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. My primary research focus revolves around the exciting field of physical human-robot interaction, where I delve into intricate control challenges related to haptics and teleoperation. At present, my work centers on the development of cutting-edge *robot haptics* technology, aimed at enhancing the resilience and agility of autonomous non-prehensile manipulation.
